By combining data visualization with actionable insights, this dashboard empowers HR teams to make informed decisions, improve retention strategies, and enhance overall workforce planning.
# Tech Stack:
The dashboard was built using following tools and technologies:
-Power BI Desktop: Used as the primary platform for building and designing the interactive dashboard.
-Power Query Editor: Utilized for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes‚Äîcleaning and shaping data from various sources.
-DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to create custom measures and calculated columns for advanced data analysis and insights.
-Data Modeling: Implemented to establish relationships between different tables, optimize data structure, and improve performance.
-File Format: The report is saved in .pbix format, the standard file type for Power BI Desktop reports.
# Highlights of dashboard:
# -Business problem:
The organization is facing a critical employee attrition issue, with turnover heavily concentrated among lower salary brackets, mid-career age groups, early-tenure employees, and specific roles such as laboratory technicians and sales executives. Key contributing factors appear to include low job satisfaction, limited opportunities for career progression, and inadequate compensation. A strategic intervention is necessary to identify the root causes, enhance employee engagement, and reduce attrition in the most affected segments.
# - Objective of dashboard:
To help the organization to improve employee performance and improve employee retention (reduce attrition) by creating HR attrition dashboard. By examining variables such as job role, salary, tenure, age group, and job satisfaction, the goal is to uncover actionable insights that will support the development of effective retention strategies. The project aims to help HR leadership make data-driven decisions to reduce attrition, enhance employee engagement, and improve overall workforce stability.
# - Walkthrough of key visuals:
 ‚óè Key KPIs (Top)- It shows that the organization has 1,470 total employees, out of which 237 employees have left, resulting in an attrition rate of 16.1%. The average age of employees is 37 years, and they earn an average salary of 6.5K. Employees have been with the company for an average of 7 years.
 ‚óè  Attrition by Gender-This bar chart compares the number of male and female employees who have left the company. It shows that 140 males and 97 females have left. This indicates that attrition is slightly higher among male employees. 
 ‚óè  Attrition by Age-This vertical bar chart illustrates the distribution of employee attrition across different age groups. The highest number of exits comes from the 26‚Äì35 age group (116 employees), followed by 18‚Äì25 (44) and 36‚Äì45 (43). Attrition significantly decreases in older age groups. This suggests that younger and early-career professionals are more likely to leave, possibly due to job-hopping, career changes, or dissatisfaction.
 ‚óè Attrition by Education-Displayed as a donut chart, this visual breaks down employee attrition based on education background. Employees with Life Sciences (38%) and Medical (27%) education have the highest attrition rates. Marketing (15%), Technical Degrees (14%), and Other (5%) follow. This helps HR understand which educational backgrounds are more prone to attrition
 ‚óè Attrition by Salary Slab-This horizontal bar chart categorizes attrition based on employee salary ranges. The majority of attrition‚Äî163 employees‚Äîis from those earning up to 5k, followed by 49 in the 5k‚Äì10k range. Higher salary ranges see much less attrition, with only 20 in the 10k‚Äì15k and 5 above 15k. This clearly shows that lower-paid employees are more likely to leave
 ‚óè Attrition by Years at Company-This line chart shows how long employees stay before leaving. The highest attrition occurs within the first year (59 employees), and it decreases significantly after that. A small peak is seen again at the 10-year mark (18 employees). 
 ‚óè Attrition by Job Role-This horizontal bar chart identifies the job roles with the highest attrition. Laboratory Technicians (62) and Sales Executives (57) experience the most turnover, followed by Research Scientists (47). Other roles like Manufacturing Director (10) and Healthcare Representative (9) see much lower attrition.
 ‚óè Job Satisfaction Based on Category-This is a matrix table that breaks down attrition by job role and satisfaction level (1 to 4). For example, 20 Laboratory Technicians left with the lowest satisfaction score (1), indicating dissatisfaction may be a strong factor in attrition for that role. 
# -Key insights:
The organization can gain key insights by using this dashboard by identifying the following:
‚óè Majority of attrition is concentrated in lower salary bands and early-career employees.
‚óè Job satisfaction alone doesn't prevent attrition ‚Äì even satisfied employees are leaving.
‚óè Sales and technical departments are most affected, suggesting possible issues in job pressure, career growth, or incentives.
‚óè Employees with Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds are leaving more, possibly due to demand in the market or better offers elsewhere.
‚óè First-year attrition spike shows potential mismatch between job expectations and reality.
# -Strategic improvements:
To reduce attrition, the company should strengthen onboarding and early engagement programs, ensuring new hires feel supported from day one. Revising compensation strategies‚Äîespecially for lower-paid roles‚Äîcan help retain talent vulnerable to competitive offers. Focused retention efforts are needed for high-turnover roles like Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives, including clearer career paths and role-specific support. Expanding development opportunities and internal mobility can engage younger employees seeking growth.
